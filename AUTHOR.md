Hello,

I am Stephen, and I am currently a senior majoring in computer science at Brooklyn College.
I really enjoy programming, however, over the past few years, I have had an ever increasing interest in
cyber security and pen-testing. I hope to get cyber security certifications once I complete my
undergraduate degree (fingers crossed). My hobbies include gaming, building racing drones, and occassionally
DJing house parties and small gigs when I have some time off from college and other responsibilities.
Welcome to my repo!
